# Fundamental Concepts

## The Core  Operating System : The Kernel
*Operating System* is commonly used with two different meanings:
- To denote the entire package consisting of the central software managing a computer's resources and all of the accompanying standard software tools, such as command line interpreters, graphical user interfaces, file utilities, and editors.
- More narrowly, to refer to the central software that manages and allocated computer resources.
The term *kernel* is often used as synonym for the second meaning.

### Tasks performed by the kernel
- **Process Scheduling**
- **Memory Management**
- **Provision of a file system**
- **Creating and terminatiohn of processes**
- **Networking**
- **Provision of a system call application programming interface (API)**

### Kernel mode and user mode
Modern processor architecture allows CPU to operate in user and kernel ( or supervisor ) mode. Memory is marked as user and kernel space. When the CPU is in user mode, it can only access user space whereas it can access both user and kernel space when in kernel mode.There exist hardware instructions that allow switching from one mode to another.
Certain operations such as initiating I/O operations, accessing memory management hardware, executing halt instruction can only be executed by the CPU while the process is operating in kernel mode.

### Process versus kernel views of the system
An executing process does not know when it will next time out or when it will next be scheduled. The delivery of signals and the occurrence of interprocess communication events are mediated by the kernel, and can occur at any time for a process. A process doesnot know where it is located in RAM, where on the disk drive the files it accesses are being held. A process operates in isolation. It can't directly communicate with another process. A process can't itself create a new process or create a new process or even end its own existence. Finally a process can't communicate directly with the input or output devices attached to the computer.
A running system has one kernel that knows and controls everything. The kernel facilitates the ruWhen a pathname is specified in a system call,
innning of all processes on the system. The kernel decieds which process will next obtain the cpu, when it will do so, and for how long. The kernel maintains all of low level data structures that enable the filenames used by programs to be translated into physical locations on the disk. The kernel also maintains data structures that map the virtual memory of each process into the physical memory of the computer and the swap areas on the disk. All communication between processes is done via mechanisms provided by the kernel. 

## The Shell
A shell is a special-purpose program designed to read commands typed by a user and execute appropriate programs in response to those commands. Such a program is sometimes known as a command interpreter.

## Users and Groups
Each user on the system is uniquely identified, and users may belong to groups.

### Users
Every user of the system has a unique login name (username) and a corresponding numeric user ID (UID). For each user, these are defined by a line in the system password file, /etc/passwd, which includes the following additional information:

- Group ID: the numeric group ID of the first of the groups of which the user is a member.
- Home directory: the initial directory into which the user is placed after logging in.
- Login shell: the name of the program to be executed to interpret user commands.

### Groups
For administrative purposes—in particular, for controlling access to files and other system resources—it is useful to organize users into groups.Each group is identified by a single line in the system group file, /etc/group, which includes the following information:
- Groups name: the (unique) name of the groups
- Groupd ID (GID): the numeric ID associated with this group
- User list: a comma-separated list of login names of users who are members of this group (and who are not otherwise identified as members of the group by virtue of the group ID field of their password file record).

### Superuser
One user, known as the superuser, has special privileges within the system. The superuser account has user ID 0, and normally has the login name root. On typical UNIX systems, the superuser bypasses all permission checks in the system. Thus, for example, the superuser can access any file in the system, regardless of the per- missions on that file, and can send signals to any user process in the system. The system administrator uses the superuser account to perform various administrative tasks on the system.

## Single Directory Hierarchy, Directories, Links, and Files

## File I/O Model

One of the distinguishing features of the I/O model on UNIX systems is the con- cept of universality of I/O. This means that the same system calls (open(), read(), write(), close(), and so on) are used to perform I/O on all types of files, including devices. (The kernel translates the application’s I/O requests into appropriate file- system or device-driver operations that perform I/O on the target file or device.) Thus, a program employing these system calls will work on any type of file.

The I/O system calls refer to open files using a file descriptor, a (usually small) non- negative integer. A file descriptor is typically obtained by a call to open(), which takes a pathname argument specifying a file upon which I/O is to be performed.

Normally, a process inherits three open file descriptors when it is started by the shell: descriptor 0 is standard input, the file from which the process takes its input; descriptor 1 is standard output, the file to which the process writes its output; and descriptor 2 is standard error, the file to which the process writes error messages and notification of exceptional or abnormal conditions. In an interactive shell or program, these three descriptors are normally connected to the terminal. In the stdio library, these descriptors correspond to the file streams stdin, stdout, and stderr.

## Programs
Programs normally exist in two forms. The first form is source code, human-readable text consisting of a series of statements written in a programming language such as C. To be executed, source code must be converted to the second form: binary machine-language instructions that the computer can understand. (This contrasts with a script, which is a text file containing commands to be directly processed by a program such as a shell or other command interpreter.) The two meanings of the term program are normally considered synonymous, since the step of compiling and linking converts source code into semantically equivalent binary machine code.

## Processes
A process is an instance of an executing program. When a program is executed, the kernel loads the code of the program into virtual memory, allo- cates space for program variables, and sets up kernel bookkeeping data structures to record various information (such as process ID, termination status, user IDs, and group IDs) about the process.

### Process Memory layout
A process is logically divided into the following parts, known as segments:
- Text: the instructions of the program
- Data: the static variables used by the program
- Heap: an area from which programs can dynamically allocate memory
- Stack: a piece of memory that grows and shrinks as functions are called and return and that is used to allocate storage to local variables and function call linkage information.
